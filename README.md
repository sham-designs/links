This is my 4th project for my class Type and Interaction.
We were assigned random Are.na channel and asked to interpret the channel, and then present the interaction using basic Javascript and HTML/CSS.
Here is my interpretation of the channel assigned to me (https://www.are.na/yuting-zhuang/amazon-forest)

I was presented with a few blocks mentioning the recent fires, and a few of the species inside the forest. With a couple more blocks I added, I have tried to show the Duality -> The Past:ThePresent of the Amazon rainforest, immersing the user is both experiences before showing a contrast on hover.
